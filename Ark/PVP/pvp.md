This ruleset applies **ONLY** to the following servers:
 
1. **Supreme Ark Center PVP (sprk-cluster-pvp)** 
1. **Supreme Ark Ragnarok PVP (sprk-cluster-pvp)** 

&nbsp;

### Global Rules

**As a general rule**, we ask that players refrain from raiding players that are not capable of mounting a proper defense. This is situational and will be dealt with on a case-by-case basis.
1. **Don't be a Jerk**, which means no griefing, trolling, or harrassing other players.
1. **DO NOT** block loot crate spawns or impede access to them by other players. In addition, building on major resource locations is not allowed. Locations with restrictions:
     - **The Center**: Skull island ( obsidian, metal, and crystal), penguin iceberg near Green Obelisk, and around the Ice Palace underneath Green Obelisk ( organic polymer), small Crystal caves in the desert, and the metal mountain in the desert.
     - **Ragnarok**: The wyvern scar or its immediate edge, and the ice wyvern spawns on snow mountains.
2. **DO NOT** misuse of bug exploits or cheating. These include building entire structures and storage containers past world limits (floor, walls, etc) that are inaccessible by any normal means or using indestructible player-crafted structures to create choke points or modify the root map design. 
1. **NO** excessive cursing, racism or hate speech in global chat or on the server Discord which extends to aliases and character names. Due to Ark catering to a younger demographic, we ask players to please refrain from excessive amounts of foul language, afterall no one likes a chat spammer. If an argument needs to happen, take it to private messages.
1. **NO** suicide bombing. This includes, but is not limited to, C4 and Rocket Launchers.
1. **DO NOT** build boxes on platform saddles that block the rider from being picked up by enemies or protect them from being shot from all angles.

&nbsp;

### Craftable Tribute Terminal

The terminal emits a beam of light like the tek transmitter, but it is red. In this way, players can differentiate between the two in the event of abuse in a PVP situation. Should abuse happen, it can be reported to the admins [here](http://www.supremeark.com/forums/topic/3/how-to-submitting-a-rule-violation). Please be advised that you must provide all required details outlined in that post including screenshots backup claims. **Any reports that are received that do not include evidence will be dismissed but tracked.**

The Craftable Tribute Terminal mod allows players to create an obelisk terminal to place in their base in order to make transfers between servers more convenient. A feature of the terminal is that it is able to be picked up and placed without limits. **Abuse of the tribute terminal will be treated as severe bug abuse and is subject to an immediate and permanent ban from all present and future Surpeme Ark services and servers. Restrictions on the tribute terminal:**

1. **DO NOT** use the terminal for **ANY** PvP related actions. The terminal cannot be used to stage dinos or transfer raid loot.
1. **DO NOT** download a dino into an area where it cannot enter by normal means. (e.g. bringing a dino in a cave where the entrance is too small for it to enter)
1. **DO NOT** use the terminal to transport raid loot.

&nbsp;

### Safe and Restricted Areas

This server is equipped with a plugin that allows us to set zones which restrict player construction and PvP damage. Restricted zones allow us to hard-protect resource rich locations so that no one player/tribe can monopolize it.

No structures are permitted underneath obilisks.

Safe zones are meant to help new players get a foothold on the servers. Every player/tribe has the right to claim a place in one of the safe zones allocated for a maximum duration of TWO DAYS. This location is for a simple structure which can be used to store collected resources in preparation for building in the open world. After their welcome expires on the starting zone, admins have the right to wipe/remove those structures without prior notice.

PvP in the designated Green Zones should be disabled, however, any method or attempt to circumvent this with be dealt with harshly. Outside of extenuating circumstances, the attack of any player or tame in the zone as well as the use of wild dinos to attack or damage any players, structures or tames within the zone will be treated the same as exploitation and result in a permanent ban.

Below you will find maps with areas highlighted indicating zones, where:
**GREEN AREAS**: Safe starting zones (PVP is disabled here)
**RED AREAS**: Restricted zones (Player building is restricted here)

&nbsp;

### Base Design Limitations

Players may follow whatever base design pattern they desire but must pay close attention to not abuse in-game mechanics that would allow them to build bases in manners that would not be conventionally possible or one that gives a severe artificial advantage.

1. **Floating Bases:** The floor of a base must not exceed a clearance greater than 12 wall units with the terrain below.

1. **Foundation Spam:** Players and tribes must make full use of their claimed territory. Claiming large areas by spamming foundations is not permitted.

&nbsp;

### Suicide Bombing

Suicide bombing is the act of attaching C4 to any creature or player living or otherwise and using that entity in a suicidal rush to someoneâ€™s base to do mass damage, or rushing someone's base with a rocket launcher and shooting it point blank for max damage, typically killing the player. If caught doing this or an act similar to this, you and anyone who assisted in this process will be banned. Dive bombing with a Griffin in a raid is to be considered suicide bombing.

&nbsp;

### Dino Armor and Rider Protection

Dino armor use is unrestricted in PvP scenarios. Armor should not exceed more than 50% coverage in online raids, and dino armor is strictly forbidden in offline raids.

Rider protection is using structures which the rider clips into while mounted on a tamed creature which prevents the rider from being picked up or taking damage from every conceivable angle. If found doing this, an admin will take appropriate action determined by the severity of the violation.

&nbsp;

### Caging and Handcuffing

Caging and handcuffing players should be limited to 30 minutes of online time. If you cage someone while they are offline, they must be uncaged/uncuffed when you log off to prevent that player from logging in and be caged for hours until someone can log in to set them free. Please refer to the "Harassment" guideline.

&nbsp;

### Cheating and Bug Exploits

Exploiting bugs in the game or in any mod to your benefit or cheating in any way will result in a ban.

&nbsp;

### Harassment

Bans or punishments are not issued on the basis of solely raiding new players or players weaker than you, this is a PVP server afterall. Ark online multiplayer is more enjoyable with others but the "multiplayer" component of Ark cannot be possible when players are driven off the server. Don't ruin your experience by ruining others'. If found raiding new players or steamrolling players who are obviously weaker than you for no obvious reason other than your amusement, admins will issue an appropriate punishment. This includes, but is not limited to:
    - Repeatedly raiding a player over a short period of time.
    - Griefing players in open world PvP (e.g. camping bodies, continuously tranqing them, etc.)
    - Any sort of shake-down or racketeering operations.
    
&nbsp;

### Violations & Punishments

Several of the rules we have here operate on a zero-tolerance policy. Admins reserve the right to determine punishment severity at their discretion.
**If rules are being violated then you must submit proof before asking an admin to investigate.** Proof can be in the form of relevant screenshots (F12 while in game to capture screen via Steam) or in the form of video if you are able to do so. **Do not come to us asking for someone to be punished without proof.** Do **NOT** leave out details just to help your case. Admins do not take kindly to lying.
The official format for reporting violations can be found [here](http://www.supremeark.com/forums/topic/3/how-to-submitting-a-rule-violation).

### Donor Items

Individuals on the servers that choose to support the server through monetary contributions in return are rewarded with unique, seasonal, or hard-to-get skins. Their contributions directly translate into continued server uptime for everyone to enjoy. It is for this reason that we ask that these skins be left alone if found during a raid, as a token of respect and gratitude. If you would like to get a hold of the skins, please support the server by donating. Donating options can be found on the [store](http://www.supremeark.com/donate/).

&nbsp;

### Style of Play

This is PVP. The rates have been established for an accelerated game play and because of this Admin roles are specific to enforcing the rules. Being raided offline or being wiped is not something that admins can help with. IF however, it is harassment then see point above.

&nbsp;

### Ark Smart Breeding App Settings

For those serious about their breeding game, [Ark Smart Breeding](https://github.com/cadon/ARKStatsExtractor) is a great tool to keep track of your dino generations and get the best out of your breeders. In addition, Supreme Ark runs bi-weekly Breeding Bonanza weekends where breeding settings are ramped up to 3x the normal Supreme Ark breeding rates noted above. The settings to use for the app on your end (both normal and Breeding Bonanza) are as follow:

![Normal and Breeding Bonanza Buff Settings](https://i.imgur.com/ekPwoff.png "Normal and Breeding Bonanza Buff Settings")

Toggle the "event" checkbox when the server is on a Breeding Bonanza weeked, which usually happens every two weeks.
