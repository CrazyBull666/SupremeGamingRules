### General Disclaimer

The general operation of these rules is more ‘spirit of the law’ mindset rather than a ‘letter of the law’ mindset, and as such are purposely loose. The absence of an item in these rules does not imply permission. If an item appears to not be in line with the following ruleset, then it is most likely to be frowned upon. Please use common sense and err on the side of caution.

**All rules are ultimately dependent upon the judgment of the admin team. If questions arise with regards to these rules, please do not hesitate to contact an admin for clarification.**

&nbsp;

### Global Rules

1. No glitching, abusing, meshing, bug or other mod exploits. 
1. No racism, sexism, or hate speech either on the server or on the Discord. This extends to Discord and in-game names/aliases as well.
1. No harassment or personal attacks upon other players either in the game or on discord. (This includes things such as handcuffing a player for a significant amount of time, spawn-camping, repeatedly raiding someone in a short period of time, or steamrolling defenseless tribes.) 
1. No blocking or impeding access to loot crate or artifact spawns. 
1. No C4/rocket running. This includes any method to quickly get to turrets and blow them up point-blank with explosives.
1. No dino armor or boxes to prevent 100% line of sight, or picking of riders on platform dinos during raids. 
1. No use of the SA Terminal during active PvP, whether that be open-world PvP or a raid. Also no transfer of raid loot with this. [Note: the Tek Transmitter and its S+ counterpart are exempt from this rule]

### Punishments

Punishment for breaking of rules is dependent upon the severity and circumstances of the rulebreak. Issues are dealt with on a case-by-case basis rather than the addition of new rules.

NOTE:  Breaking of Rule 1 is grounds for immediate permanent ban, while other rulebreaks are subject to either a temporary ban or other punishments.

### Ark Smart Breeding App Settings

For those serious about their breeding game, [Ark Smart Breeding](https://github.com/cadon/ARKStatsExtractor) is a great tool to keep track of your dino generations and get the best out of your breeders. In addition, Supreme Ark runs bi-weekly Breeding Bonanza weekends where breeding settings are ramped up to 3x the normal Supreme Ark breeding rates noted above. The settings to use for the app on your end (both normal and Breeding Bonanza) are as follow:
