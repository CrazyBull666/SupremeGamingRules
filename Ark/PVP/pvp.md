This ruleset applies **ONLY** to the following servers:
 
1. **Supreme Ark Center PVP (sprk-cluster-pvp)** 
1. **Supreme Ark Ragnarok PVP (sprk-cluster-pvp)** 

&nbsp;

### Global Rules

The Supreme Ark PVP ruleset can be loosely summarized below, however each point is covered in depth in the succeeding sections and it is the responsibility of each player to fully understand the rules as ignorance will not be an excuse upon violation of any rule.

1. **Don't be a Jerk**, which includes, but not limited to, no griefing, trolling, or harrassing other players.
1. **DO NOT** block loot crate spawns or impede access to them by other players. In addition, building on major resource locations is not allowed. Locations with restrictions:
     - **The Center**: Skull island ( obsidian, metal, and crystal), penguin iceberg near Green Obelisk, and around the Ice Palace underneath Green Obelisk ( organic polymer), small Crystal caves in the desert, and the metal mountain in the desert.
     - **Ragnarok**: The wyvern scar or its immediate edge, and the ice wyvern spawns on snow mountains.
2. **DO NOT** misuse of bug exploits or cheating. These include building entire structures and storage containers past world limits (floor, walls, etc) that are inaccessible by any normal means or using indestructible player-crafted structures to create choke points or modify the root map design. 
1. **NO** excessive cursing, **NO** racism or hate speech in global chat or on the server Discord which extends to aliases and character names.
1. **NO** suicide bombing. This includes, but is not limited to, C4 and Rocket Launchers.
1. **DO NOT** build boxes on platform saddles that block the rider from being picked up by enemies or protect them from being shot from all angles.

Any and all Rules are ultimately up to judgement and determination by the admin team. A failure of the rules to enumerate or list each and every potential instance of a potential violation shall not be construed as to allow that behavior. Flagrant disregard for the spirit and intention of the rules, attempting to skirt around the wording or appealing to technicality shall be looked upon disfavorably. Attempting to argue based on grounds of letter or technicality will likely be dismissed. Questioning of the rules is encouraged within reason and will result in no penalties. However arguing and questioning will only be entertained to clarify a true misunderstanding when a player or tribe has committed a possible violation.

&nbsp;

### Craftable Tribute Terminal

The terminal emits a beam of light like the tek transmitter, but it is red. In this way, players can differentiate between the two in the event of abuse in a PVP situation. Should abuse happen, it can be reported to the admins [here](http://www.supremeark.com/forums/topic/3/how-to-submitting-a-rule-violation). Please be advised that you must provide all required details outlined in that post including screenshots backup claims. **Any received reports lacking the necessary evidence will be dismissed.**

The Supreme Ark Craftable Tribute Terminal mod allows players to create an obelisk terminal to place in their base in order to make transfers between servers more convenient. A feature of the terminal is that it is able to be picked up and placed without limits. **Abuse of the tribute terminal will be treated as severe bug abuse and is subject to an immediate and permanent ban from all present and future Surpeme Ark services and servers. Restrictions on the tribute terminal:**

1. **DO NOT** use the terminal for **ANY** PvP related actions. The terminal cannot be used to stage dinos or transfer raid loot.
1. **DO NOT** download a dino into an area where it cannot enter by normal means. (e.g. bringing a dino in a cave where the entrance is too small for it to enter)
1. **DO NOT** use the terminal to transport raid loot.

&nbsp;

### Safe and Restricted Areas

This server is equipped with a plugin which allows zones to be marked as restricted, mechanically preventing player construction, PVP damage, or both. Certain locations on the map will be labeled as such to protect the following public resource areas:

- Ragnarok
    - Small crystal caves in desert
    - Metal mountain
- Center
    - Skull Island
- All maps
    - No militarization of obelisks

PVP safe zones are meant to help new players get a foothold on the servers. Every player/tribe has the right to claim a place in one of the safe zones allocated for a maximum duration of **TWO DAYS**. This location is for a simple structure which can be used to store collected resources in preparation for building in the open world. After reaching the time limit on the starting zone, admins have the right to wipe/remove structures without prior notice. Below you will find maps with areas highlighted indicating zones, where:

**GREEN AREAS**: Safe starting zones (PVP is disabled here)

**RED AREAS**: Restricted zones (player building is restricted here)

PvP in the designated safe zones (green areas) should be mechanically disabled and enforced, however, any method or attempt to circumvent this with be dealt with harshly. Outside of extenuating circumstances, the attack of any player or tame in the zone as well as the use of wild dinos to attack or damage any players, structures or tames within the zone will be treated the same as exploitation and result in a permanent ban.

&nbsp;

### Base Design Limitations

Players may follow whatever base design pattern they desire but must pay close attention to not abuse in-game mechanics that would allow them to build bases in manners that would not be conventionally possible or one that gives a severe artificial advantage. Such examples are:

1. **Structure Undermeshing**: Abuse of use or glitches in to build outside of normal bounds is not allowed. **ANY STRUCTURE** found outside of the normal world mesh is subject to immediate demolition. Soft spots or gaps that allow the player to fall through or pass through what should be otherwise solid surfaces do not constitute normal areas of the world.
1. **Floating Bases:** The floor of a base must not exceed a clearance greater than 12 wall units with the terrain below.
1. **Foundation Spam:** Players and tribes must make full use of their claimed territory. Claiming large areas by spamming foundations is not permitted.

&nbsp;

### Suicide Bombing

Suicide bombing is the act of attaching C4 to any creature or player living or otherwise and using that entity in a suicidal rush to someoneâ€™s base to do mass damage, or rushing someone's base with a rocket launcher and shooting it point blank for max damage, typically killing the player. If caught doing this or an act similar to this, you and anyone who assisted in this process will be banned.

&nbsp;

### Dino Armor and Rider Protection

Dino armor use is unrestricted in PVE activities. Armor should not exceed more than 50% coverage in online raids, and dino armor is strictly forbidden in offline raids.

Rider protection is using structures which the rider clips into while mounted on a tamed creature which prevents the rider from being picked up or taking damage from every conceivable angle. If found doing this, an admin will take appropriate action determined by the severity of the violation.

*Dino Armor consists of the use of structures and foundations on platform saddles to protect the rider and tame from conventional attacks*

&nbsp;

### Caging and Handcuffing

Caging and handcuffing players should be limited to 30 minutes of online time. If you cage someone while they are offline, they must be uncaged/uncuffed when you log off to prevent that player from logging in and be caged for hours until someone can log in to set them free. Please refer to the "Harassment" guideline below.

&nbsp;

### Cheating and Bug Exploits

Exploiting bugs in the game or in any mod to your benefit or cheating in any way will result in a permanent ban from all Supreme Ark services.

&nbsp;

### Harassment

Bans or punishments are not issued on the basis of solely raiding new players or players weaker than you, this is a PVP server afterall. Ark online multiplayer is more enjoyable with others, but the "multiplayer" component of Ark cannot be possible when players are driven off the server. Don't ruin your experience by ruining others'. If found steamrolling or raiding new players or obviously weaker than you for no reason other than your amusement, admins will issue an appropriate punishment. Examples of harrassment include, but is not limited to:
    - Repeatedly raiding a player over a short period of time.
    - Griefing players in open world PvP (e.g. camping bodies, continuously tranqing them, etc.)
    - Any sort of shake-down or racketeering operations.
    
&nbsp;

### Violations & Punishments

Several of the rules we have here operate on a zero-tolerance policy. Admins reserve the right to determine punishment severity at their discretion.
**If rules are being violated then you must submit proof before asking an admin to investigate.** Proof can be in the form of relevant screenshots (F12 while in game to capture screen via Steam) or in the form of video if you are able to do so. **Do not come to us asking for someone to be punished without proof.** Do **NOT** leave out details just to help your case. Admins do not take kindly to lying.
The official format for reporting violations can be found [here](http://www.supremeark.com/forums/topic/3/how-to-submitting-a-rule-violation).  
    
&nbsp;

### Donor Items

Individuals on the servers that choose to support the server through monetary contributions in return are rewarded with unique, seasonal, or hard-to-get skins. Their contributions directly translate into continued server uptime for everyone to enjoy. It is for this reason that we ask that these skins or items be left alone if found during a raid, as a token of respect and gratitude. If you would like to get a hold of the skins, please support the server by donating. Donating options can be found on the [store](http://www.supremeark.com/donate/).

&nbsp;

### Style of Play

This is PVP. The rates have been established for an accelerated game play and because of this Admin roles are specific to enforcing the rules. Being raided offline or being wiped is not something that admins can help with, unless it is clearly harrassment as outlined above.

&nbsp;

### Rules for Player vs. Player Interaction

#### Open World PVP

So long as all general server rules are followed regarding exploits, rider protection, harassment, etc. Open World PvP is unrestricted with one exception: on each map are designated safe zones, if by some means a way is discovered or used to attack players in the starter zone appropriate admin action will be taken depending on the severity of the offense.

#### Tiers of Play

Given that Ark is a game in which there are varying levels of technology, accordingly there should be varying levels of play governed by and considered by the rules.

Tiers shall apply to any member of a tribe regardless of playtime and presence on a server. Further if an infraction occurs within 1 week of departure (or it can be shown that a player was given support and aid by previous tribe members), the tribe in question shall either disavow permanently any affiliation with offending player or be held liable for their actions.

*Any player, or tribe, who engages in an attempt to raid a base no matter the tier, shall be open to retaliation from assailed tribe, and shall only be afforded protection from total wipe should they apply. Retaliation may come at the time and place of the victims choosing.  After the first successful raid, protections shall be restored.*

#### Tribes Shall be Accountable for the Aactions of their Members

Any infraction that occurs shall be the responsibility of the offending tribe as a whole. Depending on the severity, if a proper restitution is made no action will be taken other than a warning against any further misconduct. If the infraction is severe enough or has occurred after a first warning, the tribe shall be sanctioned as a whole at the discretion of the admin team. If however the tribe wishes to disavow offending members, only offending members shall be punished, however the tribe will still be responsible for restitution.

### Tiered PVP

The following tiers have been designed to ensure that combat between parties remains as fair for everyone involved. There are 5 tiers of play:

- Tier 0 (T0): Thatch & wood
- Tier 1 (T1): Stone
- Tier 2 (T2): Metal, no defenses
- Tier 3 (T3): Metal, active defenses
- Tier 4 (T4): Metal, active defenses, multi-server presence
- Tier 5 (T5): Tek or ascension

Please refer to following documentation before engaging an enemy to ensure you are elibible to attack first. In the following text, when a "+" follows a tier label, it means any tier greater than or equal to that tier (>=).

- `T3+` means: `T3`, `T4`, `T5`

 Conversely, "-" following a tier label means any tier less than or equal to that tier (<=).

 - `T3-` means: `T1`, `T2`, `T3`

#### T0: Thatch, Wood

- `T0` tribes or players are those that have literally just started on the server. `T0`'s are be encouraged to start in the new player safe zones. 
- The destruction of any `T0` by a `T3+` is not permitted. 
- Any attack upon `T0` bases offline or online by a `T3+` shall result in a minimum of a temporary ban of not less than 1 week.
- Online attacks are permitted only by a `T1-`.
- Offline attacks on a `T0` are only permitted by a `T0`. Full restitution shall be provided the event of an attack by a `T1+`. The burden of proof shall rest on the aggressor if evidence is not provided. Further attacks or failure to provide restitution shall be met with sanction including but not limited to temporary or permanent ban from all Supreme Ark services.

#### T1: Stone

- `T1` tribes and players are the weakest and most likely to be just starting out or have limited play time. Therefore they shall be afforded the most protections.
- Whether online or offline, any attack on a `T1` by a `T3+` shall be met with the highest scrutiny. The wiping of, dealing of excessive damage to a `T1` by any `T3+` shall not be permitted.
- Attacks on a `T1` by a `T3+` will be subject to immediate action. The responsible tribe will immediately be responsible full restitution of destroyed structures and dinos. The burden of proof shall rest on the aggressor if evidence is not provided; restitution value shall be determined by an admin.
- Offline raids on a `T1` base is permitted only by other `T1-`.
- Online raids are unrestricted for `T2-`.

#### T2: Metal (No Defenses)

- `T2` tribes are in a transient stage.
- This is the shift from `T1` to `T3` tribe. 
- Wiping of a `T2` is only permitted during an online raid by `T2-`.  
- Offline raiding of a `T2` base is permitted only by `T2-`.
- Online raids are unrestricted for `T2-`

#### T3: Metal (Acive Defenses)

- `T3` tribes are those that should have sufficient means and resources to mount a reasonable defense.
- Offline and online raids are unrestricted for `T3-`. Base wipes permitted.
- Offline and online raids by `T4+` are permitted within reason. Base wipes are not permitted.

#### T4: Metal (Acive Defenses, Multi-Server Presence)

- Offline raids are unrestricted for `T4-` .
- Online Raids are unrestricted for `T5-`.

#### T5: Tek and or Ascension

- `T5` tribes are the masters of the Ark and include, amongst their ranks, at least one member that has ascended at least once, make use of Tek Tier in their defenses, upon inspection are found to have tek defenses in place ready to activate in the event of an attack.
- Offline and Online Raids are unrestricted for `T5-`.

#### Temporal Raid Restrictions and Exceptions

- `T3+` tribes are permitted a **maximum** of 1 **online** raid per week of a `T2-`. That is to say if you are a member of a `T3+`, your tribe as a whole is permitted only 1 combined **online** attack of a defenseless base per week. If reported and found to be in excess of this appropriate sanction will be enforced.
- `T4+` tribes are permitted a **maximum** of 2 **offline** raids per week of a `T3`. That is to say if you are a member of a `T4+`, your tribe as a whole is permitted only 2 combined **offline** attacks on a `T3`. If reported and found to be in excess of this appropriate sanction will be enforced. 
- `T5` Tribes are restricted to a **maximum** of 4 **offline** raids per week of any `T4`. Online base wipes are permitted, but not permitted offline.

&nbsp;

### Dino Parking Map

The dino parking map is a completely **optional**, clustered, flat, PVE PGArk (Progressively Generated Ark) map available to you and your tribe intended for storing and protecting a very limited number of dinos in order provide a fallback dino pool in the event of a base wipe. This facility replaces the old passive pen rules and spec.

#### How it Works

- This is a PVE dino storage map. PVE prohibits players from maliciously wiping out protected dinos. Along with your dinos, you are allowed a 2x2x2 stone base with a bed spawn and a tribute terminal.
- As the sole purpose of this map is for dino storate, all rates have been set as low as possibly allowable by the server. Harvesting and breeding on this map are rendered impractical. Breeding will have to occur on the PVP maps, however keep in mind transferring dinos resets their breeding timers. Dino consumption rates have been dropped to prevennt dinos from starving to death.
- Structure and dino decay have been doubled to prolong protected dinos and spawn structures
- Item transfers are disabled server-side. This means only dinos and naked players are allowed entry and exit from the parking map. This makes it impossible for players and tribes to smuggle blueprints and other valuable resources. Kits are provided with essential materials for spawn structures, etc.

#### Parking Map Guidelines

If found attempting, breaking, or abusing the parking map guidelines, appropriate admin action will be taken which include but is not limited temporary or permanent forfeiture of parking garage priviliges and/or complete dino wipe from the parking map.

- Your tribe (defined as your organization and not per-map entities), is allowed to have one land area and one water area.
- Occupy no more than 20x20x12 volume units per area.
- Hitchposts will be provided to maintain your dinos within your area. Any loose and wandering dinos are subject to deletion without prior notice. Repeated incidents will result in elevated action described above.
- Your tribe is limited to storing a **maximum** of 250 dinos on this map. This is a server-side enforced limit. Creating multiple tribes to circumvent the limit is a violation of the general guideline described above.

#### Kits

Given item transfers are disabled (in or out), tribes wil be unable to transfer in the resources necessary to download/upload dinos or structures for a storage area. We have designed kits available to fill this hole. These kits include:

- 1 Supreme Ark Terminal
- 4 hitching posts
- 73 fence foundations to mark off the storage area
- 1 behemoth gate
- 1 behemoth gateway
- 4 stone foundations
- 15 stone walls
- 1 reinforced door
- 1 stone doorway
- 4 stone ceilings
- 1 bunk bed
- A variety of common primitive dino saddles to facilitate dino movement. If your tribe is storing a dino for which a saddle we do not provide in the kit, one will not be provided.

### Ark Smart Breeding App Settings

For those serious about their breeding game, [Ark Smart Breeding](https://github.com/cadon/ARKStatsExtractor) is a great tool to keep track of your dino generations and get the best out of your breeders. In addition, Supreme Ark runs bi-weekly Breeding Bonanza weekends where breeding settings are ramped up to 3x the normal Supreme Ark breeding rates noted above. The settings to use for the app on your end (both normal and Breeding Bonanza) are as follow:

![Normal and Breeding Bonanza Buff Settings](https://i.imgur.com/ekPwoff.png "Normal and Breeding Bonanza Buff Settings")

Toggle the "event" checkbox when the server is on a Breeding Bonanza weeked, which usually happens every two weeks.
