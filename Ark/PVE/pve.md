This ruleset applies **ONLY** to the following servers:

1. **Supreme Ark Aberration PVE (sprk-cluster-pve)** 
1. **Supreme Ark Center PVE (sprk-cluster-pve)** 
1. **Supreme Ark Island PVE (sprk-cluster-pve)** 
1. **Supreme Ark Ragnarok PVE (sprk-cluster-pve)** 
1. **Supreme Ark Extinction Core PVE (sprk-cluster-pve)** 

&nbsp;

### Global Rules

1. Build ANYWHERE (including caves) as long as it does not block loot crate spawns or impede access to them by other players. In addition, building on major resource locations is not allowed. Locations with restrictions:
  - **The Center**: Skull island ( obsidian, metal, and crystal), penguin iceberg near Green Obelisk, and around the Ice Palace underneath Green Obelisk ( organic polymer)
  - **Ragnarok**: The wyvern scar or its immediate edge, and the ice wyvern spawns on snow mountains.
1. **DO NOT** bring flyers to the Aberration map. Any non-native flyers on Aberration will be immediately destroyed on sight by admins. This is considered an exploit and will be dealt with accordingly.
1. No misuse of bug exploits or cheating. These include building entire structures and storage containers past world limits (floor, walls, etc) that are inaccessible by any normal means or using indestructible player-crafted structures to create choke points or modify the root map design. These actions prevent players from potentially building in a desired location or ruin the natural beauty of the map.
1. No excessive cursing, racism or hate speech in global chat or on the server Discord which extends to aliases and character names. Due to Ark catering to a younger demographic, we ask players to please refrain from excessive amounts of foul language, afterall no one likes a chat spammer. If an argument needs to happen, take it to private messages.
1. Don't be a jerk, which means no griefing, trolling, or harrassing other players. This also extends to stealing from other's containers, killing players and dinos, or interrupting tames. PVE servers are for relaxed players who just want to build and breed without the toxicity of a PVP atmosphere.

*"Do unto others as you would have them do unto you"*

### A note on the Craftable Tribute Terminal

The Craftable Tribute Terminal mod allows players to create an obelisk terminal to place in their base in order to make transfers between servers more convenient. A feature of the terminal is that it is able to be picked up and placed without limits. This opens up a vast number of possibilities and for PVE servers is not an overly large issue however there are some points that must be clarified:

* Anything relating to PvE such as gathering and dino transport are allowed. There is no limit to its use in PvE scenarios provided its use doesn't conflict with other existing rules.

The entire point behind allowing the use of the tribute terminal is to ease the transport of dinos and resources, and as a workaround to reduce the lag of high gather dinos. The terminal should not be used to import a dino to a place where it cannot be introduced by conventional methods (e.g. bringing titanos into cave systems where entrances would never allow a titanosaur to fit through). If a dino can be introduced by conventional methods, it can be introduced by a terminal.

*Be responsible with the pillars you place down. They are not demolishable by anybody else but the tribe that placed them down. We admins do not have the time to go around and cleaning out terminals whenever they are abandoned and someone else wants to build where they are placed. If you place a tribute terminal please pick it up after you are done transferring/transporting items or creatures.*

&nbsp;

### Building on Restricted Areas

Building on restricted areas are subject to admin intervention. Informing the player or tribe of the violation is the first step and their subsequent cooperation will determine further action. Banning is often unnecessary, as we simply do not wish for the structure to be there.

In the event that a restricted location is blocked or built on, or a red surface, cave, or deep sea drop is blocked [provide us with the required documentation](http://www.supremeark.com/forums/topic/3/how-to-submitting-a-rule-violation). If it is any other color surface drop that is blocked we would encourage the community to kindly inform players that they are building in a location where a drop spawns and should create access points to reach the drops. If a player or tribe refuses to comply, please follow the link aforementioned to submit a report.

&nbsp;

### Cheating and Bug Exploits

More often than not this will lead to a permanent ban. However, if the circumstances are extenuating, then we might lessen the punishment.

&nbsp;

### Territory Claims

Each tribe is allowed up to a maximum of two bases. Bases are defined as main centers of operation where the majority of tribe and player time is spent. There is no limit to the number of "outposts" a tribe may have but be mindful about placing too many. Ask yourself whether it is an absolute necessity over just convenience. Outposts should be limited to barebone basics such as a bed, a terminal, and one or two crafting stations. If we find players abusing and spamming outposts all over the map, we will be forced to modify the rule and implement a hard limit so please don't ruin it for yourself and others.

Structure spamming will not be tolerated. This includes any form foundations, pillars, or any other structure spamming that will prevent other players from building on a location. If you have no immediate use for the territory, do not build on it.

When starting a base or expanding a build, ensure that you are not blocking in another tribe's base. Please do not build on more than two sides of an already existing tribe. If an already existing tribe has another tribe blocking two sides, please move a little farther away before placing any structures and leave ample room to allow room for expansion for both parties.

Do not block natural resources, paths or obelisks with permanent structures. Ensure that your build does not severly cripple dino spawns especially in tight spaces like caves.

&nbsp;

### Killing Players or Tames

Even though this is a PVE server, there are still creative ways which players can use to kill players or their tames. Any action that leads to a player or tamed dino death are forbidden. Some examples are:

- Carrying them with a flyer and dropping them.
- Dropping wild dangerous dinos into their base.
- Luring dangerous dinos into their area (such as the giga) on purpose.
- Blocking off natural player spawn points and forcing them to starve.

Anyone caught maliciously killing off players or tamed dinos will be banned permanently. There is no room for toxic behaviour on a PVE server.

If you accidentally build on a natural player spawn, make sure you provide at least one way out in addition to leaving some clues as to how to get out. Your base may not be as intuititve as you think.

The only time where player and dino deaths are allowed are when both parties agree to and declare war using Ark's mechanics.

&nbsp;

### Base Raiding

PVE is about relaxing with friends, building, breeding, and facing all that the harsh Ark environment has to throw at you. There is no room for PVP activities outside of declared war or server events. Players should and will not take advantage of unlocked or incomplete bases and steal items out of unlocked containers. If you need something, ask. PVE players are eager to help each other out which makes the need to steal irrelevant.

If you are caught stealing in someone else's base on PvE (whether the doors or windows are open or not), you ***WILL*** be banned.

&nbsp;

### Map Structure Clutter

Tribes will often move their base to a new area, create temporary structures for taming, or place campfires temporarily to cook meat on-the-go or keep warm at night. Please remember to tear these down when you're finished with them to reduce on server clutter and make room for other people to potentially use the area.

Players and tribes also sometimes create rafts to travel to different places on the map. Please don't block inlets or rivers. Once you find you no longer use your rafts, please demolish them!

&nbsp;

### Tamed Dino Clutter

Please help the map remain tidy. Keep your tamed dinos within the boundaries of your base and do not let them roam free on the map while on wander.

&nbsp;

### Violations & Punishments

As PVE is all about having a friendly atmosphere, building, breeding, and trading with other players any behaviour that does not agree with the spirit of friendliness will be dealt with punishments. Violations that originate from toxic behaviour will more often times result in an immediate and permanent ban. For other smaller recurring violations, admins reserve the right to issue punishments at their discretion.

If rules are being violated then you must submit proof before asking an admin to investigate. Proof can be in the form of relevant screenshots (F12 while in game to capture screen via Steam) or in the form of video if you are able to do so. Do not come to use asking for someone to be punished without proof. Do ***NOT*** leave out details just to help your case. Admins do not take kindly to lying.

The official format for reporting violations can be found [here](http://www.supremeark.com/forums/topic/3/how-to-submitting-a-rule-violation).

### Donor Items

Individuals on the servers that choose to support the server through monetary contributions in return are rewarded with unique, seasonal, or hard-to-get skins. Their contributions directly translate into continued server uptime for everyone to enjoy. It is for this reason that we ask that these skins be left alone if found during a raid, as a token of respect and gratitude. If you would like to get a hold of the skins, please support the server by donating. Donating options can be found on the [store](http://www.supremeark.com/donate/).

### Ark Smart Breeding App Settings

For those serious about their breeding game, [Ark Smart Breeding](https://github.com/cadon/ARKStatsExtractor) is a great tool to keep track of your dino generations and get the best out of your breeders. In addition, Supreme Ark runs bi-weekly Breeding Bonanza weekends where breeding settings are ramped up to 3x the normal Supreme Ark breeding rates noted above. The settings to use for the app on your end (both normal and Breeding Bonanza) are as follow:

![Normal and Breeding Bonanza Buff Settings](https://i.imgur.com/ekPwoff.png "Normal and Breeding Bonanza Buff Settings")

Toggle the "event" checkbox when the server is on a Breeding Bonanza weeked, which usually happens every two weeks.
